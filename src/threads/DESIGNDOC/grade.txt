    * I'm putting this on all of the ddocs, but try to use 'git pull --rebase'

      to pull new commits without always making a new merge commit.

-3: There's something very wrong about lines 748-751 on thread.c.

    Please put brackets or else that might've been a huge problem if the 'if'

    statement didn't always return.

-3: You should be storing the wake-up time instead of the ticks-until-wake in

    the thread. If you store NOW+offset, then all you need to do is compare your

    time to the wake-up time, instead of having to update the ticks every timer

    interrupt.
